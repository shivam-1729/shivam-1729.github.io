        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I am Shivam. I have been working as a Software Engineer at <a href="//www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> for the past two years. I'm based out of Bengaluru.
	    I'm presently working in the Azure Managed Disks team, where I have been building features and services for high performing disk volumes with over 99.999% availabilty and upto 160K IOPS.
	    Previously I was working in the Azure Blob Management team, where I helped develop a Blob(Binary Large Object) Inventory feature, which, using a publisher-consumer model,
	    can be used to list and collate information about billions of blobs each day for thousands of users.
	    <br><br>	
	    I completed my Bachelor's from the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering at the <a href="//www.iitkgp.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur</a>, with a Minor in Computer Science and Engineering.
            I have had a lot of fun exploring Theoretical Machine Learning, Federated Learning, Security, and Robotics through my various experiences.
	    I am curious about everything under the sun and was an active member of the Quiz Club at IIT KGP. I regularly host and take part in open quizzes in Bengaluru.
            <br><br>
            Feel free to check out my resume and drop me an e-mail if you want to chat with me!
